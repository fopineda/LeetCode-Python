# LeetCode-Python

Project consists of multiple folders that contain a screenshot of a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) question and its respective code answer.

Code is technically not able to be run unless you copy and paste into the Leetcode website or if you modify it to be able to run.

## Purpose
Project is was created to maintain accountability for a 30-day coding question challenge.

It is also a read-only reference for Leetcode questions.

Questions range from arrays/lists to tree questions. Some are easy questions while others are considered intermediate level.

Be advised, answers are not optimized. Answers posted were the first version deemded acceptable by the Leetcode website. During this challenge, I was also studying for my Security+ certification and working on other projects. It was meant as "don't get rusty" project.

## Results
Project was fun and committing it to Github daily made sure I stayed on top of answering a question per day.

I ended up doing well on the Security+ exam! ðŸ˜Š

I highly recommend using coding question websites like leetcode to study for programming/engineering/coding interviews. Trust me, it helps out a lot.
